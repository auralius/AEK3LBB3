# Demo-3: Simple CNN with ArduinoÂ¶

![](./images/demo_cnn.gif)

Even though this method is no longer a linear method, we will put the Arduino codes [in the same repository.](https://github.com/auralius/arduino-linear-classifier)

Check the `cnn` folder.
 
This demonstration also uses [the USPS dataset.](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html#usps)

The matrix is obtained from [the previous CNN topic.](https://auralius.github.io/AEK3LBB3/cnn.html)
