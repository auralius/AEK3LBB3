# Linear classifier Demostration

This is a demonstration for the linear classifiers (SVM and Softmax).

The classifier is used to classify handwritten digits that can be found in [UCI machine learning repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/80/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits)

There is also a demonstration by using the USPS dataset, which has higher resolution (16x16). 
 
The demo still works with Arduino UNO R3. In fact, this is where we meet the storage limit of our Aduino UNO R3.
